## Project: Scientific Document Detection and Analysis System

### 1. Overview
The goal of this project is to develop an intelligent system capable of analyzing an image (from PDF or picture) and determining whether it represents a **scientific article**.  
If it is not a scientific document, the system will notify the user accordingly.  
If it is, the system must extract, quantify, and summarize textual information while checking compliance with document length requirements.

---

### 2. Problem Statement
Researchers and organizations often deal with large collections of unstructured PDF or image files. Manually identifying which ones are valid scientific articles is time-consuming.  
This system automates that process by combining **document segmentation**, **text extraction**, and **language model summarization** to classify and analyze documents efficiently.

---

### 3. Objectives
- Detect whether a given image or PDF represents a **scientific article**.  
- Extract and quantify the number of **paragraphs**.  
- Identify and count the **most frequent words** in the text.  
- Generate an **automatic summary** of the content.  
- Verify whether the document meets the rule:
  - **> 4 paragraphs**
  - **> 2000 words**

### 4. Functional Requirements
| ID | Requirement | Description |
|----|--------------|-------------|
| FR-1 | Document Detection | Identify if an image/PDF corresponds to a scientific article. |
| FR-2 | Paragraph Segmentation | Detect and count paragraphs within the document. |
| FR-3 | Text Extraction | Extract the textual content from the image using OCR. |
| FR-4 | Word Frequency Analysis | Quantify the most frequent words across the text. |
| FR-5 | Summarization | Generate a concise summary of the extracted text using a LLM. |
| FR-6 | Compliance Check | Evaluate if the document satisfies the rule (>4 paragraphs and >2000 words). |
| FR-7 | Feedback to User | Display validation message (valid article / invalid document). |

---

### 5. Non-Functional Requirements
| ID | Category | Description |
|----|-----------|-------------|
| NFR-1 | Accuracy | OCR and segmentation should achieve >90% accuracy on academic documents. |
| NFR-2 | Performance | Average processing time ≤ 10 seconds per document. |
| NFR-3 | Usability | Simple interface with upload and result visualization. |
| NFR-4 | Modularity | Components (OCR, segmentation, LLM summarizer) must be modular. |
| NFR-5 | Privacy | No storage of document data after analysis. |

---

### 6. Constraints
- Must **use a segmentation technique** for paragraph detection.  
- Must **use LLM only for summarization** (not for classification or segmentation).  
- Input formats: `.pdf`, `.png`, `.jpg`.  
- Output format: JSON + human-readable summary.  

---

### 7. Success Criteria
- Correctly identifies scientific articles with ≥95% accuracy.  
- Generates summaries consistent with document content.  
- Provides clear feedback when document is invalid.  

---

### 8. Tools and Technologies
- **OCR**: Tesseract, EasyOCR, or PaddleOCR  
- **Segmentation**: OpenCV, spaCy, or layout-parser  
- **LLM**: GPT-5 API (text summarization only)  
- **Backend**: Python (FastAPI or Flask)  
- **Frontend (optional)**: Streamlit or React for visualization

---

### 9. Future Enhancements
- Citation and reference extraction  
- Topic classification (e.g., Computer Science, Biology)  
- Integration with document databases (Semantic Scholar, arXiv)
